# ProgrammingAssignment4
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate collecting, working with and cleaning a data set. The goal was to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This project uses data collected from the embedded accelerometers and gyroscopes in the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

This repository contains:
- _[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/AH-Miller/ProgrammingAssignment4/blob/main/run_analysis.R)_, the R script for running the analysis. Requires the [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to be downloaded and unzipped in the working directory.
- _[summary_data.txt](https://github.com/AH-Miller/ProgrammingAssignment4/blob/main/summary_data.txt)_, the final tidy dataset.
- _[Codebook.md](https://github.com/AH-Miller/ProgrammingAssignment4/blob/main/Codebook.md)_, the codebook describing the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.
